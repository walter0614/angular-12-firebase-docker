# Angular-12-Firebase-Docker
Build Angular 12 CRUD App with Firebase Realtime Database that uses `AngularFireDatabase` service.

- Each Tutorial has key, title, description, published status.
- We can make CRUD operations: create, retrieve, update, delete Tutorials.

## Development server

Run `docker-compose up --build` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
